NOTICE:
    To provide a more stable graphical user experience in Crostini,
    the GPU-based rendering driver (virgl) has been disabled by default
    for existing and new environments in ChromeOS version 131 and newer.

    OpenGL and OpenGLES applications will continue to function using a
    CPU-based rendering driver (swrast).

    If you would like to re-enable GPU-based rendering in an unsupported
    capacity, you may visit:  chrome://flags#crostini-gpu-support
    in your Chrome browser and set the flag to "Enabled", then restart
    your device.
