[BBX: DONE :-)]

Emergency (magit): Magit requires ‘seq’ >= 2.24,
but due to bad defaults, Emacs’ package manager, refuses to
upgrade this and other built-in packages to higher releases
from GNU Elpa.

To fix this, you have to add this to your init file:

  (setq package-install-upgrade-built-in t)

Then evaluate that expression by placing the cursor after it
and typing C-x C-e.

Once you have done that, you have to explicitly upgrade ‘seq’:

  M-x package-install seq \‘RET’

[BBX: That did not work. I just listed the packages and searched for seq. Then, it all installed fine.]

Then you also must make sure the updated version is loaded,
by evaluating this form:

  (progn (unload-feature 'seq t) (require 'seq))

If this does not work, then try uninstalling Magit and all of its
dependencies.  After that exit and restart Emacs, and only then
reinstalling Magit.

If you don’t use the ‘package’ package manager but still get
this warning, then your chosen package manager likely has a
similar defect. Disable showing Disable logging
Emergency (transient): Transient requires ‘seq’ >= 2.24,
but due to bad defaults, Emacs’s package manager, refuses to
upgrade this and other built-in packages to higher releases
from GNU Elpa, when a package specifies that this is needed.

To fix this, you have to add this to your init file:

  (setq package-install-upgrade-built-in t)

Then evaluate that expression by placing the cursor after it
and typing C-x C-e.

Once you have done that, you have to explicitly upgrade ‘seq’:

  M-x package-upgrade seq \‘RET’

Then you also must make sure the updated version is loaded,
by evaluating this form:

  (progn (unload-feature ’seq t) (require ’seq))

Until you do this, you will get random errors about ‘seq-keep’
being undefined while using Transient.
